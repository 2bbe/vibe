# Install notes
## System requirements
Windows: Version `8` greater.

Hardware:
No special requirement. resource usage can be customized through advanced settings in main window.

Currenly, `MacOS` computers get the best performance since there's GPU optimizations.

## Ubuntu
Please install the following packages
```console
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libgcc-s1 libc6 zlib1g libselinux1 libpcre3 libbz2-1.0 liblzma5 libcap2 libexpat1 libgpg-error0 libdbus-1-3 libcom-err2 libc6 libncursesw6 libtinfo6 libpulse0 libc6 libkeyutils1 libc6
```
And for install the `deb` file -> download it and execute
```console
dpkg -i ./vibe*.deb
```
Currenly, listening for the audio file isn't supported on `Linux`
And using the `appImage` isn't recommended.

## Offline installation

1. Stop the program

2. Download it from [ggml-medium.bin](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-medium.bin?download=true)

3. Place it in the folder `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\github.com.thewh1teagle.vibe` With the exact name `ggml-medium.bin`
